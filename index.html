            <h1>Lets Help Those Who Are More In Need</h1>
            <p>Help is a word that implies assistance in doing certain kind of work. It can include several factors such
                as
                financial help, mental help, physical help, etc. No matter what kind of help you offer, no matter whom
                you
                help,
                it is more important to notice that another person is gaining something just because of you and your
                help.
